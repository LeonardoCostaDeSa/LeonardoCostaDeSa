### OlÃ¡, Hello, Salut! ðŸ‘‹

My academic and professional background spans software development, digital marketing, and linguistic studies, driven by curiosity and a constant pursuit of improvement. I hold a bachelor's degree in Portuguese-French Literature and Linguistics from University of SÃ£o Paulo and I am currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC Praia Grande, with a focus on front-end development and software architecture, aligning with my goal of building scalable and user-friendly applications.

Professionally, I work at a startup as a Software Engineer, where I am responsible for implementing agile methodology in the company's development process and overseeing the technical aspects of the project. In addition to my role as a Scrum Master, I also contribute to game development, using the Unity IDE and C# to create movement, interactions, and logic.

Beyond my experience in software development and agile methodologies, I work as a freelancer on web development projects, such as the website for Revisa Master, a company specializing in academic review and guidance. The first version of the company's website, currently in operation, was built using Wix, a no-code platform. Now, I am optimizing its performance by improving loading times, responsiveness, and accessibility while adding customized functionalities with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to expand the companyâ€™s presence in Portugal.

In digital marketing, as a Communication Strategist, I developed content strategies that led to a growth of 27,000 new followers on social media in one year. As a Digital Marketing Specialist at Garden SÃ£o Paulo, I was responsible for developing the company's website with optimized SEO, which contributed to an 80% increase in gross revenue in the first year and 110% in the second.

Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, innovate, and build something meaningful. I am committed to continuous learning and leveraging technology to create impactful solutions that shape the future.
