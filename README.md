### OlÃ¡, Hello, Salut! ðŸ‘‹

My academic and professional trajectory is multidisciplinary and has been guided by curiosity and the constant pursuit of improvement. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Portuguese-French Language and Literature from USP and am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC Praia Grande.

Currently, I work as an Artificial Intelligence Solutions Consultant at KPMG Brazil, in the Tax Transformation area. I am part of a multidisciplinary team responsible for developing AI-based and automation solutions to optimize tax and cross-sector processes. We work with technologies such as RPA, Web Scraping, and Artificial Intelligence to automate workflows and data analysis, contributing to clients' digital transformation and supporting strategic decision-making.

Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Caju GameLabs, where I was responsible for implementing the Scrum agile methodology in the team's development process. I coordinated ceremonies such as planning, daily standups, reviews, and retrospectives, as well as managing the backlog and delivery schedules. I was also responsible for creating UML diagrams to assist in system modeling and communication among team members. This experience strengthened my skills in organization, technical leadership, and collaborative task management in development environments.

In addition to working with AI and agile methodologies, I also worked as a freelancer on web development projects, such as the Revisa Master website â€“ an academic review and guidance company. Initially hosted on Wix, I restructured the project to accommodate the company's expansion into Portugal, creating a new version focused on performance, responsiveness, and accessibility. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Flask for the backend, with an API for email management via SMTP. I configured the server environment with venv, Gunicorn, and Nginx, optimizing the application's scalability and security.

In digital marketing, as a Communications Strategist, I developed content strategies that resulted in growth of 27,000 new social media followers in just over a year. As a Digital Marketing Specialist at Garden SÃ£o Paulo, I developed the company's website with optimized SEO, contributing to an 80% increase in revenue in the first year and 110% in the second.

Every challenge I face represents a new opportunity to innovate, grow, and generate impact. I remain committed to continuous learning and using technology to develop solutions that truly make a difference.
